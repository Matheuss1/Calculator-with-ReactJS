# Calculator-with-ReactJS
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is a simple calculator made with ReactJS, containing just the basic math operations. This wasn't made
to be a perfect calculator and without bugs, but to test and to learn some react tools instead. So, you can find
some bugs like numbers going out of the screen, if you are using very large values.**

__This calculator style was inspired (almost the same,btw) in this calculator made with Vue.JS -> [VueJS calculator](https://codepen.io/ClementRoche/pen/zmzwEJ) . But the code in this repository was all made by myself, using React and SCSS to style__
